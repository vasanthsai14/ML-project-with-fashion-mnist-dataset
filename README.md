# ML-project-with-fashion-mnist-dataset
This is a basic image detection deep learning project using Fashion mnist dataset. The machine learning model is implemented using tensorflow . 
This is a Convolutional Neural Network model where data is taken from fashion mnist. This fashion mnist data consists of images of shirts , shoes , sweaters , boots , etc. 
The model divided the dataset into two sections ( for training and test)
Training data is used to train the model to detect the images and classify it with the prediction analysis.
Finally , test data is used to evaluate our model.
